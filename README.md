# Edge-mongodb

Edge with mongodb support. Currently just set up to work with a locally running mongodb instance.
Below is the original Edge documentation.

# Edge

From "Datum edge". Also represents the 'edge' of our current thinking
on the baseline architecture of Clojure projects. It contains
architectural patterns for the rapid construction of robust and
flexible systems.

## Features

Edge is a simple project demonstrating the following:

### A boot-driven Clojure/ClojureScript dev and prod environment

```
boot dev
```

Browse to localhost:3000

Make changes to the Clojure code and reset the system

```
user> (reset)
```

### A SASS CSS build

Make changes to the sass files under sass.

### API server

- [A Stuart Sierra component reloaded project](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)
- Use of `schema.core/defrecord` to validate your system's integrity on every reset
- Run all your tests with `(test-all)`
- bidi & yada for serving web resources and APIs

## Running

Edit the sass files in `sass`, Clojure, ClojureScript and .cljc files in `src`, and other assets in `assets`.

```
boot dev
```

## ClojureScript REPL

An optional ClojureScript REPL is available. Create a new REPL by connecting to localhost on port 5600. You can do this with boot, lein, CIDER or with another IDE. Once the REPL has started, launch the CLJS repl with the following:

```
user> (cljs-repl)
```

This should connect with your browser and you can then interactively work with cljs.

## Libraries

- aero
- aleph
- bidi
- hiccup
- selmer
- yada

## CIDER integration

These instructions are for use with CIDER 0.12 (Seattle). If your
Emacs is using a previous version, you should upgrade now.

Add the following to your `$HOME/.boot/profile.boot`

```clojure
(deftask cider "CIDER profile"
  []
  (require 'boot.repl)
  (swap! @(resolve 'boot.repl/*default-dependencies*)
         concat '[[org.clojure/tools.nrepl "0.2.12"]
                  [cider/cider-nrepl "0.12.0"]
                  [refactor-nrepl "2.2.0"]])
  (swap! @(resolve 'boot.repl/*default-middleware*)
         concat '[cider.nrepl/cider-middleware
                  refactor-nrepl.middleware/wrap-refactor])
  identity)
```

Start your REPL with the following

```
boot cider dev
```

From Emacs, use `M-x cider-connect`

Use port 5600 to connect for a server CLJ REPL

## Deployment

A systemd wrapper script is provided in the top level directory. It takes a parameter which determines the Aero profile to use. In this way you can have multiple systemd units with different profiles on the same machine, even under the same username.
