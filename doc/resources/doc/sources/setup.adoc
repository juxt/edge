= How to build your own project upon Edge

Edge is designed to be built upon.
You are free to make whatever changes you like (additions and deletions), in accordance with the <<_license>> (MIT).

== Clone Edge

We anticipate you a clone of Edge per context producing a group of applications.
In this case, context might be you alone as a hobbyist, within a company, or as a small team in a larger company.

Edge can be used to co-host multiple applications in a single repo, this is to encourage re-use and modularization.

NOTE: Windows WSL users should perform the clone outside of the Linux filesystem.  For most users this will mean `/mnt/c/Users/$USER/`.

.Clone fresh project
[source,shell]
----
src$ git clone https://github.com/juxt/edge.git acme
Cloning into 'acme'...
src$ cd acme
acme$ git remote remove origin <1>
acme$ git remote add origin git@github.com:acme/acme.git <2>
----
<1> Remove the default Edge upstream, this is to prevent you from accidentally pushing there!
<2> Replace `acme/acme` with the name of your freshly created repo on Github, or generally the git url you intend to use.  This is optional if you're not planning on using git beyond locally.

In order to have access to updates from Edge periodically, such as dev/prod enhancements and bug fixes, we recommend merging Edge upstream periodically.

[source,shell]
----
acme$ ./bin/update-edge
----

WARNING: A refactoring occurred around the 18th of March 2019 which requires you to run `./bin/update-edge` twice.

== Create a new app

With your new project created, you're ready to create an app.
Apps are deps.edn projects within Edge which are intended to be run as a server or similar.

From the root of the repo, run the `./bin/app` script.
It can be run with an optional flags which add support for Sass or Clojurescript, these are `--sass` and `--cljs` respectively.

[NOTE]
====
Your project name should be namespaced to match your application.
If your company was named "Acme" you might use "acme/api" or "com.acme/api".

If you're unsure, use your company name at work, or your github username for hobby projects.
There's a low chance of conflicts in an application.

The project namespace will determine the Clojure namespaces within your application.

[source,shell]
----
edge$ ./bin/app acme/api
edge$ ./bin/app acme/blog --sass
edge$ ./bin/app acme/dashboard --cljs
edge$ ./bin/app acme/radar --sass --cljs
----

== Documentation

We think it's a good idea to continue to document your project as we've done with Edge.
You might want to update the CSS stylesheet, source highlighting and other Asiidoctor attributes.
They can be found in `doc/resources/doc/asciidoctor/attributes.edn`.

=== Updating the footer in HTML documentation

If the footer has a copyright declaration from JUXT, you can update
this by updating `doc/resources/doc/docinfo/docinfo-footer.html`. This
file name must not be changed as it is looked for by Asciidoctorj when
generating the HTML output.
