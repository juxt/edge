= lib

Here you will find libraries which support your applications.
Some are Edge libraries (prefixed with "edge.") and some of them are yours.

Feel free to add new libraries to this folder to support your application.
You can refer to them from your `deps.edn` like so:

[source,clojure]
----
group/name {:local/root "../lib/group.name"}
----

In a library, you should add a dependency on another library by doing "../".

[source,clojure]
.edge.app/deps.edn
----
juxt.edge/edge.system {:local/root "../edge.system"}
----
